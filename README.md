This is an implementation of a basic reinforcement deep Q learning system. The game is simple, move the white pixel (golf ball) into the black pixel (hole). There are 8 possible actions, four directions and two clubs. One club travels 5 pixels with random directional error up to one pixel. The other club, the putter travels one pixel.
